# Done

Archive of completed `TODO.md` items: what was built and the key files touched.

## 2026-09-30: design decisions for the port

- Agreed with the user how SLURM-REAL is ported into nanoHPC: scope (up to about 100 heterogeneous machines), role layout (optional separate `/home` storage and backup machines), Slurm built from source, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04/26.04, local users, `cluster.yml` with a wizard, admin-defined partitions, kept extras, HTTPS, rsync backup, MIT license.
- Agreed the testing setup: Lima VMs on macOS and Linux, a 6-node everyday test cluster, up to 20 compute nodes, fake GPUs.
- Files: `PROJECT.md`, `TODO.md`, `md/plan-port.md`, `md/testing.md` (was `md/testing-options.md`).

## 2026-09-30: `cluster.yml` format and validation (M1)

- Agreed the `cluster.yml` format with the user: roles per machine (`front`, `home`, `backup`, `compute`), optional aliases, optional home disk, CPU-only nodes, scratch as a disk or an image file, admin-defined partitions, policy with defaults.
- `nanohpc validate cluster.yml` reports every error with the field path, exits 1 on errors, and changes no machine. It catches duplicate YAML keys, wrong types, unsafe values (SSH key lines, system user names and UIDs, loopback addresses, `/` as backup path), storage roles combined with compute, and limits no machine can meet.
- Files: `pyproject.toml`, `src/nanohpc/config.py` (validator, ported from SLURM-REAL's `filter_plugins/cluster_machine_config.py`), `src/nanohpc/cli.py`, `examples/cluster.yml`, `examples/minimal.yml`, `tests/test_config.py`.
